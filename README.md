## Documentation

A training on how to create your own website using Volto is available as part of the Plone training at [https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html](https://training.plone.org/5/volto/index.html).

## Quick Start

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn start:prod`

Runs the compiled app in production.

You can again view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

### `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `yarn i18n`

Runs the test i18n runner which extracts all the translation strings and
generates the needed files.

### mrs-developer

[mrs-developer](https://github.com/collective/mrs-developer) is a great tool
for developing multiple packages at the same time.

mrs-developer should work with this project by running the configured shortcut script:

```bash
yarn develop
```

Volto's latest razzle config will pay attention to your tsconfig.json (or jsconfig.json) file for any customizations.

In case you don't want (or can't) install mrs-developer globally, you can install it in this project by running:

```bash
yarn add -W mrs-developer
```
yarn -v

## Automated @eeacms dependencies upgrades

All the addon dependencies that are located in the dependencies section of `package.json` file that belong to @eeacms and have a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version are automatically upgraded on the release of a new version of the addon. This upgrade is done directly on the `develop` branch.

Exceptions from automated upgrades ( see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies for dependency configuration examples ) :
* All github or local paths
* Any version intervals ( `^version` or `>version` or `MAJOR.MINOR.x` etc )

## Release

See [release](https://github.com/eea/ims-frontend/tree/master/RELEASE.md)

## Production

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to deploy this application in production.

### Deploy

* Within `Rancher > Catalog > EEA`

### Upgrade

* Within your Rancher environment click on the `Upgrade available` yellow button next to your stack.

* Confirm the upgrade

* Or roll-back if something went wrong and abort the upgrade procedure.
